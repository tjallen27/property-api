# SOLACE PROPERTY RENTAL

### The main aim of this project was to simply work on my Ruby skills

## I decided that I wanted to take a step further than a simple Rails blog so I decided to make an estate agency app.

# By allowing people to upload their own properties and have a contact form so people can contact them directly.

The API was built in Rails and the front end was built with Angular
